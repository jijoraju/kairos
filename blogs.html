                      What would we do if we didn't have coffee? How would we
                      survive the day without them? this delectable beverage?
                      The reality is, whether we like it or not, admit it or
                      not, the aroma and flavour of this delicious drink entice
                      us to get out of bed and start our day. It is a tremendous
                      source of motivation that motivates us to overcome every
                      single everyday challenge and stay energised even when we
                      are utterly spent and fatigued. That is one of the
                      numerous reasons why it is so popular.

                          It is undeniably true that a morning does not begin
                          until you have had your coffee. Coffee is the magical
                          morning potion for many of us—something that hasn't
                          and won't change throughout time. It's ingrained in
                          many different nations' customs and heritage. If
                          coffee were a language, we're guessing that by now,
                          more than half of the universe would be speaking the
                          same language, albeit with distinct accents.

                      When it comes to a good cup of coffee, everyone has their
                      favourite cafés and go-to coffee shops, but knowing how to
                      brew your own at home might be a life-changing skill for
                      those days when you're stuck at home or simply too busy to
                      get to your favourite coffee shop.

                      Many of us begin our days with a cup of much-needed
                      coffee. We feel the warmth of the mug in our hands as we
                      watch the steam rising from the cup. We drink the nutty,
                      somewhat bitter tea and feel our brain rev up.
