              Despite having a bad reputation in the past, coffee is now touted
              as being healthy and packed with much-needed antioxidants. Some
              studies have even shown that coffee drinkers live longer and have
              a lower risk of serious diseases, so having a few cups of coffee a
              day is actually going to be beneficial to your health, not
              detrimental.
